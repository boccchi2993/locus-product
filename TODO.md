# Locus TODO

This file is for concrete implementation work.

Architecture-level decisions belong in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md and docs/MODEL-PROTOCOL.md. Milestones belong in ROADMAP.md.

## Next — Runtime / Harness / Product extraction

Contract and gates: [REPOSITORY-SPLIT.md](docs/REPOSITORY-SPLIT.md). M0–M2 are complete; M3/M4 are pending.

- [x] M0: inventory ownership and freeze public behavior/contract tests at an exact baseline. (Completed at `d25f30e` on `docs/repository-split-m0`: [inventory](docs/REPOSITORY-SPLIT-INVENTORY.md), [contracts](docs/REPOSITORY-SPLIT-CONTRACTS.md), [baseline results](docs/REPOSITORY-SPLIT-BASELINE.md) — 41/41 unit suites, build, real-world-50 fixture checks, and the browser e2e set verified at that commit; `python-authority` and `network` failed in the single sequential run and passed standalone re-runs; first-failure root cause not confirmed — see baseline §3.)
- [x] M1a: extract the task lifecycle and provider-session orchestration from the UI store into Vue-free harness modules (`src/harness/task-runner.js`, `src/harness/provider-session.js`), wire the store through them, and correct the M0 contract claims that affected implementation. (Completed on `refactor/repository-split-m1a`; see [M1a verification](docs/REPOSITORY-SPLIT-M1A-VERIFICATION.md).)
- [x] M1b: interpreter lifecycle behind an explicit runtime handle (per-instance `createPythonRuntime()` factory with prepare/run/reset/dispose/snapshot; the product store owns the ONE canonical instance and injects it into preparation, session reset and shell execution — no page-global `PythonRuntime` remains), and the `~/.skills` shell rules moved behind the mutation-policy port (`src/mutation-policy.js`, injected per bash call, loud failure when missing). (Completed on `refactor/repository-split-m1b`; see [M1b verification](docs/REPOSITORY-SPLIT-M1B-VERIFICATION.md). M1 as a whole is COMPLETE: task setup/run/cancel/reset exercises without the `PythonRuntime` global and skill-path enforcement comes from injected product policy.)
- [x] M2a: Runtime independentization — the public entry (`src/runtime/index.js`: `createRuntime → RuntimeHost → RuntimeSession`), worker sources as Runtime-owned asset modules (`src/runtime/worker-assets.js`; the `#py-worker-src`/`#grep-worker-src` page elements are gone), status events replacing the `#sb-python` DOM write and the 1-second poll (`session.onStatus`), `LOCUS_HOME_SKELETON` as an explicit VFS constructor argument (neutral generic default), Runtime-owned payload-identity contract data (equality with the Harness copy pinned), `ConversationHistoryWorkspace` moved to Product files, the execution-authorization port replacing chat identities in the Runtime's network layer, a session-layer prepare barrier (waits for in-flight executions; cancel/reset/dispose during the wait refuses the configuration), and the Product execution chain routed through the entry (`executeTool` requires `opts.runtimeSession`; no second execution path). Independence gates A–G landed (standalone Node gate, packaged-browser host `dist/tests/runtime-host.html`, prepare-barrier/isolation suites, structural dependency-boundary checks). (Completed on `refactor/repository-split-m2a`, stacked on M1b @ `83fdfbb`; see [M2a design](docs/REPOSITORY-SPLIT-M2A-DESIGN.md) and [M2a verification](docs/REPOSITORY-SPLIT-M2A-VERIFICATION.md).)
- [x] M2b: Harness independentization — the public entry (`src/harness/index.js` + self-assembly `core.js`: `createAgentSession`, `createApprovalController`, `createModelClient`, task-runner/provider-sessions, the image gate, the capability-composition core) over the declared `__LOCUS_HARNESS_CORE__` table; the §3.2 ToolPort with per-task frozen definition snapshots (prompt, request.tools, validators and unknown-tool errors share one snapshot; assembly errors fail before any model request); the description port (Runtime `session.describeCommands()` adapted by the Product; no port → no capability claims); the rebuilt product-agnostic `buildSystemPrompt`; `createModelClient` with captured config/transport/relay eligibility; `capabilities.js` explicit dependencies (required persistence, explicit probe client); the extensions.js ownership split (`src/extension-composition.js` vs Product adapters, narrow instance-storage port, pure mount specs); the contained telemetry sink; the Product rewired through the entry. Independence gates H1–H11 landed (`tests/harness-standalone.test.mjs`, `tests/harness-boundary.test.cjs`, `tests/harness-prompt-parity.test.mjs`). (Completed on `refactor/repository-split-m2b`, stacked on M2a @ `ce471b0`; see [M2b design](docs/REPOSITORY-SPLIT-M2B-DESIGN.md) and [M2b verification](docs/REPOSITORY-SPLIT-M2B-VERIFICATION.md).)
- [x] M2c: Product integration adaptation + compatibility acceptance gate — both cores publish PUBLIC capability declarations (Runtime `capabilities()` with `commands` from the actual command registry and `limits` from the core's real constants; the Harness entry's `harnessCapabilities()` with port versions — including the taskLifecycle outcome enum from the runner's real constant — and semantic capabilities, the internal registry version surfaced as `registryVersion`, a distinct concept from the public `contractVersion`), the Product owns the compatibility check (`src/product/core-compatibility.js`: frozen explicit `PRODUCT_CORE_REQUIREMENTS`, structured `CompatibilityError` with code/core/port/capability/required/provided; missing declarations reject — undefined never defaults to compatible; unknown extras never reject; optional capabilities degrade only through documented product rules), wired at the head of the production `prepareTask` BEFORE required persistence / image ingest / capability refresh / Runtime prepare / model requests (rejections ride the runner's existing `blocked` mechanism — no second task_end or slot-release path; test hooks must assemble declarations explicitly, no skip mode), the production tool adapter extracted as the shared Vue-free factory (`src/product/tool-adapter.js`; store and tests call the SAME implementation; `executeTool` remains the only tool adaptation path), joint suites I1–I7 over the REAL store entry (real Harness → real adapter → real Runtime → real VFS; scripted model transport only) and the packaged-build browser joint gate (`tests/e2e-product-joint.cjs`, real chain incl. a real verified Pyodide bootstrap, cancel, approval deny, compat failure; full unit gate 56/56, full e2e 18/19 sequential with python-authority green standalone — the documented M0-baseline flake disposition). (Completed on `refactor/repository-split-m2c`, stacked on M2b @ `506c96f1`, PR base `refactor/repository-split-m2b`; see [M2c design](docs/REPOSITORY-SPLIT-M2C-DESIGN.md) and [M2c verification](docs/REPOSITORY-SPLIT-M2C-VERIFICATION.md). M2 as a whole is COMPLETE.)
- [ ] M3: extract Runtime and Harness repositories with provenance, independent CI and pinned consumption; remove duplicate product implementations.
- [ ] M4: land product compatibility adapters, exact dependency lock, latest-main integration and browser acceptance gates.


## Done on feat/linux-like-vfs-v1

- [x] Linux-like VFS v1 (docs/LINUX-LIKE-VFS.md): always-on `VirtualWorkspace` mount table with longest-prefix routing; skeleton `/bin /usr /home /tmp /mnt`; `/home/locus` + `/tmp` + `/mnt/download` (MemoryWorkspace, quota-bounded), `/mnt/upload` (read-only UploadWorkspace holding real File objects), `/usr/bin`+`/bin` reflecting the live SHELL_COMMANDS registry, `/mnt/plugins` reserved; optional `/mnt/workspace` (LocalDirectoryWorkspace) with mount = session boundary
- [x] Shell + Python converge on one model-visible namespace: VFS-absolute paths everywhere, invocation-local cwd (default `/mnt/workspace` else `/home/locus`), `HOME`/`PATH`/`TMPDIR`, protected-root rm refusals, read-only mount preflight for mv/redirects/curl -o before any side effect
- [x] Python worker protocol v2: per-mount sync with absolute paths, managed subtree cleanup (never rmtree of Pyodide `/usr` `/home` `/tmp`), os.chdir to the shell cwd, read-only mount write-back rejected at commit with source bytes untouched
- [x] UI: real File uploads with deterministic `name (2).ext` collision naming and real VFS paths in the composer; Artifacts section in the Context Rail listing `/mnt/download` recursively with explicit local Download (Blob + object URL, no auto-trigger, no network)

### Audit remediation round (F-01..F-05)

- [x] F-01 byte-preserving append: `>>` / `2>>` read the existing target as raw bytes and write old+new in ONE write — binary files survive an append byte-exactly; existing content bounded by `APPEND_MAX_EXISTING_BYTES` (16 MiB, loud failure above it); read/quota/cancel failures leave the source untouched
- [x] F-02 empty directories are synced into the Python mirror (directory manifest per mount), so a real empty VFS dir is a valid Python cwd; a cwd is only ever mirrored when the VFS itself confirms it exists
- [x] F-03 Python directory semantics persist: worker protocol v2.1 reports `createdDirs` (parent-first) / `deletedDirs` (child-first); commit order mkdir → file writes → file deletes → dir deletes; read-only mounts reject directory mutations at commit; file↔directory type changes fail loudly (never a half-applied state); `/tmp` mirror dirs are tracked and cleaned like `/tmp` files
- [x] F-04 task-bound VFS: `VirtualWorkspace.fork()` gives every task an independent mount table over shared providers — a workspace switch can never rebind an in-flight task; mountFolder re-checks the busy gate AFTER the picker/permission awaits
- [x] F-05 `curl -o` onto an existing directory fails before any network request

## Done on feat/shell-compat-baseline

Unix compatibility baseline (so future telemetry records unknown gaps, not known ones):

- [x] Shell parser/executor: `;`, `&&`, `|` composition; quoted operators stay data; unsupported syntax (`&`, `<`, trailing `|`/`&&`) fails with the supported alternative
- [x] Invocation-local virtual cwd (`cd`, `pwd`); every bash call starts at the VFS default cwd (`/mnt/workspace` when mounted, else `/home/locus`); escaping the filesystem root is rejected; relative paths resolve against cwd in ls/cat/echo redirect/find/grep/head/tail/wc/python script/curl -o
- [x] `ls -a/-l/-h` (combined flags, dotfile semantics, human sizes)
- [x] `find` subset (`-name` `*?` glob, `-type f|d`, `-maxdepth N`), bounded + deterministic + cancellation-aware
- [x] `grep` subset (`-n -i -r -R -E`, JS regex semantics), bounded, binary-safe skip, cancellation-aware
- [x] `head`/`tail` (`-n N`, `tail -n +N`), `wc` (`-l -w -c`, `-c` = UTF-8 bytes); stdin consumers: cat/grep/head/tail/wc
- [x] Pipeline inter-stage cap (`SHELL_PIPE_MAX_BYTES` = 1 MiB) fails loudly
- [x] `SHELL_COMMANDS` registry = single source for runtime dispatch, `help`, and the system prompt
- [x] MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS 15 → 32 (S14/S14c cover both sides of the cap)
- [x] Compound telemetry: one network op keeps its real backend; multiple → `operation: "compound"`

### Shell compatibility round 2

- [x] Executor-internal stdout/stderr separation (`{success, stdout, stderr}` per simple command; merged only at the tool boundary for presentation)
- [x] Pipeline forwards stdout only; a failed left stage no longer stops right stages; pipeline status = last stage
- [x] `||` fallback operator; `&&`/`||` chains are left-associative
- [x] Generalized redirection at the execution layer (no longer echo-only): `>` `>>` `2>` `2>>` `2>&1`, applied left to right (`> all.txt 2>&1` ≠ `2>&1 > out.txt`); other fds (`1>&2`, `3>`, `&>`) rejected
- [x] `mv` (file→file, file→dir, bounded recursive directory move, multi-source into dir; destination-exists fails loudly, no `-f`); copy-verify-then-delete: source is never removed before the destination landed
- [x] `rm` (`-f` `-r`/`-R` combined flags); protected VFS roots (`/`, `/usr`, `/home`, `/home/locus`, `/mnt`, `/mnt/workspace`, `/mnt/upload`, `/mnt/download`, `/mnt/plugins`) hard-refused for recursive delete; recursive delete checks cancellation before every removal and reports committed deletions without fake rollback
- [x] Telemetry: mutating shell commands report `operation: "filesystem"` (backend `browser`)

## Done on fix/v0.3-reliability

Two audit rounds (baselines da94d1f and 40a22d2) are complete; checked items
below are reflected in the roadmap sections.

### Round 1 (V0.3, commit 40a22d2)

- [x] Real-directory stat options + exists() fault propagation (F01)
- [x] Write-back failure stops deletions; staged commit states reported honestly (F04)
- [x] External-edit conflict detection on write/delete (F11)
- [x] Skipped snapshot paths recorded and protected from overwrite (F10)
- [x] Workspace switch = real session boundary (cancel task, generation, Python rebuild) (F02/F03)
- [x] End-to-end cancellation (model → tools → python → write-back) (F07)
- [x] Model envelope + error taxonomy; relay authoritative errors preserved (F08/F09)
- [x] Network deadlines/caps/anonymity; no CORS misclassification (F07/F13)
- [x] Python stdout/stderr/output caps enforced in-worker (F18)
- [x] Pyodide init-failure recovery (F14)
- [x] Quote-aware tokenizer; unsupported shell syntax fails loudly (F15)
- [x] Relay null-body statuses, stream-error mapping, /proxy inbound limits, active-content isolation (F12/F16/F05)
- [x] Session reset command + history budget (F17)

### Round 2 (V0.3.1)

- [x] Output-limit overflow returns structured `uncollectedFiles`; incomplete change sets block deletions (rename no longer loses files)
- [x] Network deadline/cancel covers headers AND full body (direct, relay, relay error JSON); every read races the abort signal
- [x] Cancel reachable while busy: status-bar button + Escape, verified through real UI events in headless Chrome
- [x] Cancellation re-checked after every async pre-check (conflict detect, delete validation, echo/curl write-back, workspace collection)
- [x] History transport budget in UTF-8 bytes (incl. reasoning/native fields); whole-task trimming via internal `_taskStart` markers; oversized single task fails loudly
- [x] Model body-read failures after headers classified as BodyReadError (no relay fallback, no double-billed inference)
- [x] verify-active-content serves the real functions/fetch.js handler response

### Round 3 (V0.3.2)

- [x] Cancel vs session switch distinguished in the agent loop: a current-session cancel after a completed tool call shows the tool's real commit report (written/deleted/not-persisted), records it in history and stops the model loop — cancellation is never presented as a rollback; a session switch still discards late results without leaking them
- [x] Stream cleanup (reader.cancel()) on timeout/cancel/size-cap exits is best-effort and never awaited in network.js and model.js — a hanging or rejecting cancel() can no longer block the caller or cause unhandled rejections; error classification preserved
- [x] relayTimeoutMs is a real NetworkRuntime.fetch option, plumbed fetch → _relay; N23 now proves the passed deadline is actually used (elapsed-time assertion) and that the 45s default is retained

## Completed — V0.2.1

### Network consistency

- [x] Add timeout to NetworkRuntime browser-direct fetch.
- [x] Add browser-direct response-size cap.
- [x] Avoid unbounded arrayBuffer() reads for large direct responses.
- [x] Keep browser-direct and edge-relay timeout/error semantics aligned.
- [x] Check target authority before starting curl -o downloads (writable mount + parent dir, before any network request).
- [x] Add regression tests for direct-fetch timeout.
- [x] Add regression tests for direct-fetch response-size cap.
- [x] Add regression test proving curl -o to a non-writable path (unmounted /mnt/workspace, read-only /mnt/upload) performs no network request — while /mnt/download works with no workspace mounted.

## Deferred runtime reliability improvements

Not blocking AgentSession / provider architecture work.

- [ ] Bound the workspace collection phase (huge directory traversal has no deadline yet).
- [ ] On-demand file bridging or incremental sync instead of full snapshot per python call.
- [ ] file↔directory type-change commit semantics in snapshot/diff (currently a loud refusal, never a half-applied state; empty-directory preservation itself is done — see F-03 above).
- [ ] `lstat`-style handling for special entries in the Pyodide MEMFS walk.
- [ ] API base URL normalization hints (e.g. base already ending in `/v1` → avoid `/v1/v1/...`).

## V0.3 — Agent loop / UI separation

### Runtime boundary

- [x] Introduce AgentSession or equivalent UI-independent runtime. (`src/agent.js` `AgentSession`)
- [x] Remove terminal object from agent-loop function signatures. (`runAgentTask(term, …)` → `session.run(input, { workspace })`)
- [x] Remove direct term.echo / render calls from runtime logic. (V0.3: terminal rendering in ui.js; V0.4: removed, Vue store consumes events)
- [x] Remove direct DOM dependencies from the agent loop.
- [x] Inject model adapter instead of reading presentation globals. (`modelClient` injection; `Model.model` is added by the presentation wiring)
- [x] Inject workspace/session state instead of reading App.workspace directly. (workspace bound per `run()` call)
- [x] Keep tool execution behind a runtime dependency boundary. (`toolExecutor` injection)
- [x] Make one complete agent loop runnable in tests without DOM/UI. (`tests/agent.test.cjs` runs the full loop in Node)

### Runtime events

A small provider-neutral event surface is implemented and consumed by the
presentation store in `src/ui/store.js`:

- [x] task_start
- [x] reasoning (full provider-visible reasoning; presentation truncation is a UI concern)
- [x] tool_call
- [x] tool_result (incl. backend/operation routing metadata)
- [x] assistant_text
- [x] warning (model_truncated / answer_truncated / task_cancelled / task_cancelled_committed / session_changed / iteration_limit)
- [x] error
- [x] task_end

Do not over-design the event schema before the first real consumer exists.

### Model protocol

- [x] Replace callModelText() with a structured callModel() response.
- [x] Introduce a response envelope.
- [x] Separate visible content from provider-native replay state.
- [x] Preserve native assistant messages when exact replay is required.
- [x] Preserve reasoning_content when a provider/model requires it.
- [x] Preserve Anthropic-style thinking/redacted/opaque blocks when required.
- [x] Do not expose opaque continuation state as user-visible prose.
- [x] Do not invent reasoning for providers that do not return it.
- [x] Keep provider-specific replay policy inside provider adapters. (`src/model-adapters.js`: `OpenAIAdapter` / `AnthropicAdapter` behind `getProviderAdapter()`; model.js keeps only transport/fallback orchestration)
- [x] Explicit API dialect override (`auto`/`openai`/`anthropic`) so arbitrary hostnames/gateways can pick a protocol; provider identity stays decoupled from API dialect.
- [x] Preserve stop reason.
- [x] Preserve usage metadata where available.
- [x] Add tests for raw reasoning replay (round-trip: parse → rawMessage → next request body, `tests/model-adapters.test.cjs` O6–O8 / A6–A7 / I3 / I5).
- [ ] Add tests for reasoning summary presentation.
- [x] Add tests for opaque-state preservation (redacted_thinking / unknown blocks survive parse→replay byte-identically and never render as visible reasoning).
- [x] Add tests proving visible UI history is not used to reconstruct provider history. (events are never serialized; provider history is session-owned, `tests/agent.test.cjs` S2/S11)
- [x] Reset/scope provider-native state when switching workspace/session.

### Network virtualization (declared gap, see README security note)

- [ ] Route Python-originated HTTP through the same Locus network capability used by shell networking, using an internal bridge where browser constraints require it.
- [ ] Preserve routing, bounds, cancellation and telemetry when Python HTTP moves onto the shared network path.

## V0.4 — Vue presentation layer

Prerequisite: AgentSession must already run without UI dependencies.

### Project structure

- [x] Introduce Vue 3 + Vite. (`package.json`, `vite.config.js`, `src/main.js`, `src/App.vue`)
- [x] Move current presentation into Vue components/store. (`src/components/`, `src/ui/store.js`)
- [x] Keep runtime modules framework-independent. (runtime `src/*.js` are classic scripts; no Vue imports — grep-verified)
- [x] Remove jQuery Terminal as an architectural dependency. (`src/ui.js` deleted; jQuery/jQuery-Terminal CDN removed from index.html)
- [x] Decide whether a terminal-style component remains as a visual surface. (No terminal surface; a reserved, clearly marked Terminal drawer is the future entry point — not wired to any shell semantics)
- [x] Pure event→timeline projector, framework-independent and Node-tested. (`src/ui/projector.js`, `tests/presentation.test.cjs`)

### Main interface

- [x] Conversation timeline.
- [x] User message cards.
- [x] Assistant final output (markdown-lite, escape-first).
- [x] Collapsible reasoning panels (full content preserved, `summary` labeled "Reasoning summary").
- [x] Tool-call panels (collapsible; long inputs folded).
- [x] Tool-result panels (attached to their call; long outputs folded).
- [x] Backend badge: browser / browser-direct / edge-relay / cloud (only from event metadata).
- [x] Workspace selector/status (composer chip + context rail; mount = real session boundary).
- [x] Model/provider configuration (Settings panel: key, endpoint, model, dialect, proxy).
- [x] Execution/debug telemetry panel (context rail Telemetry section).
- [x] Clear error presentation.
- [x] Busy/cancel state where supported (composer Cancel + Escape; AgentSession remains the real guard).
- [x] Conversation history sidebar (New task / search / recents; page-lifetime only, no durable persistence).
- [x] Composer `+` context menu: Upload files (seam, marked not-wired) / Mount folder (working) / Open terminal (reserved drawer).
- [ ] Durable conversation persistence across reloads (recents are page-lifetime by design for now).
- [ ] Attachment runtime pipeline (upload UI seam exists; files are never sent to the agent yet).
- [ ] Direct user terminal over the shared workspace authority (drawer reserved; no shell semantics added).

### UI rule

The Vue layer consumes runtime events.

Do not move provider serialization, tool semantics, execution routing, or agent-loop decisions into Vue stores/components.

## V0.4 — Runtime substrate completion

### JavaScript runtime

- [ ] Add isolated JavaScript Worker runtime.
- [ ] Never eval model-generated JS in the main UI/application context.
- [ ] No DOM access from model-generated JS.
- [ ] No access to API keys/sessionStorage/application globals.
- [ ] Define timeout.
- [ ] Terminate/recover Worker after timeout.
- [ ] Define input/output byte limits.
- [ ] Add heredoc-style js command if useful.
- [ ] Add regression tests for isolation.
- [ ] Add regression tests for timeout/recovery.
- [ ] Add regression tests proving application globals are inaccessible.

### Deterministic edit capability

- [ ] Define minimal semantic edit operations.
- [ ] Exact read.
- [ ] Exact write.
- [ ] Exact replace.
- [ ] Fail when old text is absent.
- [ ] Fail when old text is ambiguous unless explicitly allowed.
- [ ] Insert operation if justified.
- [ ] Preserve workspace path confinement.
- [ ] Record edits in telemetry.
- [ ] Test model reliability with edit as shell command.
- [ ] Test model reliability with edit as structured tool.
- [ ] Choose the smaller/reliable model-facing interface based on evidence.

## Core freeze checklist

Do not declare core frozen until:

- [ ] Execution substrate is reliable for the supported userland runtimes.
- [ ] Filesystem/state substrate is reliable and deterministic.
- [ ] Network is a common runtime capability rather than a curl-only special case.
- [ ] Python HTTP access can reuse the controlled Locus network path for normal lightweight workflows.
- [ ] JavaScript userland runtime is isolated and reliable.
- [ ] Edit/state mutation is deterministic.
- [x] Current curl connectivity is bounded and reliable.
- [x] Workspace authority is explicit.
- [x] Agent loop is UI-independent.
- [x] Model protocol preserves provider-native continuation semantics.
- [x] Runtime event stream exists.
- [ ] A capability can be added without editing the agent loop.

## V0.5 — Extension layer

### Capability registry

- [ ] Define minimal capability descriptor around execution / filesystem / network plus higher-level providers.
- [ ] Register current runtime capabilities through the same conceptual interface where practical.
- [ ] Support dependency declaration.
- [ ] Support availability checks.
- [ ] Support provider/backend metadata.
- [ ] Avoid exposing every capability as a new model tool.

### Plugins

- [ ] Define minimal plugin manifest.
- [ ] Plugin can declare required runtime capabilities.
- [ ] Plugin can provide Python packages.
- [ ] Plugin can provide JavaScript/WASM packages.
- [ ] Plugin install/load failure is isolated and visible.
- [ ] Build one boring reference plugin before designing a marketplace.
- [ ] Suggested reference: openpyxl or another small package-backed capability.

### Skills

- [ ] Define skill discovery/loading format.
- [ ] Skill can declare capability/plugin dependencies.
- [ ] Skill grants no new authority.
- [ ] Build one reference workflow skill.
- [ ] Keep skill text out of core system prompt unless selected/relevant.

### MCP

- [ ] Define MCP capability bridge.
- [ ] Keep credentials outside ordinary curl/plugin semantics.
- [ ] Surface MCP tools through explicit authority boundary.
- [ ] Preserve auditability of external actions.
- [ ] Build one reference MCP integration only after the capability registry is stable.

## Deferred / explicitly not now

- [ ] Real cloud_bash provider.
- [ ] Remote Docker sandbox.
- [ ] Browser automation.
- [ ] Authenticated website sessions.
- [ ] LibreOffice integration.
- [ ] Native ffmpeg integration.
- [ ] Compiler-specific core tools.
- [ ] Plugin marketplace.
- [ ] Full POSIX shell.
- [ ] Full curl implementation.
- [ ] RAG as a core primitive (local retrieval should compose Plugin + Skill; durable/external retrieval should normally be MCP).
- [ ] Local model runtime.
- [ ] Vue migration, MCP, JS userland runtime, edit capability (pre-AgentSession).
- [ ] Domain allowlists (provider/site-agnostic by design).

These may become future providers/plugins/community work. They are not prerequisites for freezing the Locus core architecture.
