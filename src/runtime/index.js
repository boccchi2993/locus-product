// ============================================================
//  LOCUS RUNTIME — PUBLIC ENTRY (M2a + review round)
//
//  createRuntime → RuntimeHost → RuntimeSession: the importable
//  boundary the contract drafts (docs/REPOSITORY-SPLIT-CONTRACTS.md
//  §3.1/§3.6/§3.8) prescribe. Importing this module starts no worker,
//  downloads no Python and touches no DOM.
//
//  ASSEMBLY (review round): the entry assembles its own dependencies.
//  Two modes, ONE implementation set — never a second copy of state:
//    1. CLASSIC REGISTRY: the host page loaded the core classic scripts
//       (telemetry/workspace/vfs/network/shell); shell.js published the
//       frozen __LOCUS_RUNTIME_CORE__ table. The entry DELEGATES to that
//       table, so a mixed page keeps exactly one copy of every core
//       definition (the product page path).
//    2. SELF-ASSEMBLY: no registry — the entry dynamically imports its
//       own copy of the SAME five sources through ./core.js (one memoized
//       import). The core files publish their cross-file names explicitly
//       so the identical sources work as ES modules. Merely not having
//       preloaded the classic scripts is therefore NOT an error; a broken
//       or partial registry, or missing worker assets, still is.
//  The dynamic import never fires on a registry page: the product bundle
//  never fetches the self-assembly chunk.
//
//  WHAT A SESSION OWNS (review round): one interpreter instance
//  (createPythonRuntime — all interpreter mutable state stays inside it,
//  M1b), the status listener fan-out, the prepare serialization chain,
//  AND the full lifecycle of every accepted public execute — from
//  admission (queued behind an in-flight prepare barrier) to complete
//  settlement, INCLUDING composite shell work (VFS writes, grep, curl,
//  python-inside-shell), which counts exactly once.
//
//  TWO SEPARATE INVALIDATION ALGEBRAS:
//    - the SESSION boundary generation (session.reset/dispose) — a real
//      boundary: invalidates in-flight executes (via a session-owned
//      cancellation plane merged with the caller's signal), refuses every
//      prepare it crossed, and blocks not-yet-started side effects of
//      queued work. Already-dispatched provider operations are awaited
//      and reported honestly — never rolled back, never a fake success.
//    - the INTERPRETER generation (instance reset/dispose) — bumped by
//      legitimate prepare rebuilds (a key change tears down and rebuilds
//      the interpreter) as well as by boundaries. A prepare that waited
//      judges only the SESSION algebra: a concurrent prepare's rebuild is
//      normal serialized work, not an external reset.
//
//  A host needs exactly: this module + the worker assets. VFS helpers
//  (createWorkspace/createMemoryWorkspace) are exported for hosts; they
//  delegate to the resolved core — call them after createRuntime().
