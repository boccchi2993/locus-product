# Locus Roadmap

This roadmap describes architectural milestones, not every implementation task.

The project should prefer depth and semantic correctness over rapidly expanding the number of tools.

## Next architectural priority — three-repository split

Status: target agreed; implementation pending. See [REPOSITORY-SPLIT.md](docs/REPOSITORY-SPLIT.md).

Extract independently usable Runtime and Harness repositories; retain this repository as the Product integration owner. Complete contract inventory, task assembly extraction, explicit modules, external repository extraction and product compatibility gates before further extension-layer expansion. Preserve existing behavior and authority guarantees throughout.

Product continuously integrates both latest mainlines while shipping exact tested commit pairs. This milestone does not mark Trusted Plugin Runtime or other extension work complete.

## V0.2 — Browser-native network execution

Status: implemented.

Completed:

- local workspace access,
- Python execution in Pyodide Worker,
- local file create/modify/delete/rename sync,
- browser-local curl compatibility command,
- direct browser fetch,
- transparent /fetch relay fallback,
- provider-agnostic model /proxy relay,
- execution telemetry,
- regression coverage for model/network/proxy/runtime behavior.

The V0.2 milestone proves:

> internet data -> browser/edge connectivity -> local workspace -> local compute -> local artifact

without requiring a remote execution sandbox.

## V0.2.1 — Network semantic cleanup

Status: implemented (completed in later commits; regression coverage in `tests/network.test.cjs`).

Goal: make direct browser networking obey the same resource semantics as the edge relay.

Completed:

- timeout on browser-direct network reads,
- browser-direct response-size cap,
- bounded streaming/reads instead of unbounded `arrayBuffer()`,
- `curl -o` fails before any network request when no workspace is selected,
- consistent direct/relay timeout and error semantics.

No new model-facing capability was introduced in this milestone.

## V0.3 — Architecture stabilization

Goal: separate the agent runtime from presentation and preserve model-native conversation semantics.

### Agent/UI separation

Status: implemented (`src/agent.js` `AgentSession`; terminal adapter removed in V0.4 — the Vue presentation store now consumes the event stream; Node coverage in `tests/agent.test.cjs`).

- [x] remove direct terminal/DOM dependencies from the agent loop,
- [x] replace runAgentTask(term, ...) style coupling,
- [x] introduce an AgentSession or equivalent runtime object,
- [x] expose structured runtime events,
- [x] inject workspace/model/execution dependencies rather than reading UI globals,
- [x] make the full agent loop testable without presentation code.

### Model protocol refactor

Status: implemented (`src/model-adapters.js` ProviderAdapter boundary + provider-neutral transport in `src/model.js`; Node coverage in `tests/model-adapters.test.cjs`).

- replace string-only callModelText semantics with structured model responses,
- separate visible assistant content from provider-native replay state,
- preserve reasoning/continuation state when required,
- keep opaque provider state intact,
- isolate provider-specific serialization/parsing/replay behind the ProviderAdapter interface,
- explicit API dialect override (auto/openai/anthropic) for arbitrary endpoints, provider identity decoupled from dialect,
- support reasoning presentation independently from transport,
- ensure workspace/session switching scopes all provider state.

See docs/MODEL-PROTOCOL.md.

### Unix compatibility shell baseline

Status: implemented (`src/shell.js` parser/executor + `SHELL_COMMANDS` registry; Node coverage in `tests/shell-compat.test.cjs`, browser coverage in `tests/e2e.html` section N).

Goal: accept the small Unix vocabulary capable models already speak, so telemetry records genuinely unknown capability gaps instead of known low-level compatibility gaps.

- [x] bounded command composition parsed by Locus itself (`;`, `&&`, `||`, `|`; no eval, no system shell),
- [x] invocation-local virtual cwd (`cd`), every bash call starts at the workspace root, confinement preserved,
- [x] `ls -a/-l/-h` incl. combined flags; `find`/`grep`/`head`/`tail`/`wc`/`sort` subsets with explicit bounds and cancellation,
- [x] pipeline stdin consumers (`cat`/`grep`/`head`/`tail`/`wc`); piping into non-consumers fails loudly; 1 MiB inter-stage cap fails loudly; pipelines forward stdout only,
- [x] stdout/stderr separated inside the executor; generalized redirection (`>`, `>>`, `2>`, `2>>`, `2>&1`) applied left to right,
- [x] `mv` / `rm` as workspace-confined, cancellation-aware filesystem commands (`rm -rf /` hard-refused),
- [x] one canonical capability registry drives runtime dispatch, `help`, and the system prompt,
- [x] tool iteration budget raised 15 → 32.

Explicitly deferred: `&`, `$()`, backticks, subshells, variables/export, glob expansion, input redirects, arbitrary file descriptors, `sed`/`awk`/`xargs`/`jq` and many other Unix utilities.

## V0.4 — UI rebuild and runtime substrate completion

Goal: make the UI reflect an execution harness rather than a terminal-only demo, while finishing the target runtime substrate.

### Vue UI

Status: implemented (Vue 3 + Vite; `src/main.js`, `src/App.vue`, `src/components/`, `src/ui/store.js` + pure projector `src/ui/projector.js`; Node coverage in `tests/presentation.test.cjs`, real-browser UI coverage in `tests/e2e-ui.cjs`).

The presentation is a Cowork-style agent workspace — a left task-history sidebar (New task / search / recents), a quiet centered timeline, a bottom composer with a `+` context menu (Upload files / Mount folder / Open terminal), and a collapsible right rail for progress / working folder / context / telemetry. Everything rendered is projected from AgentSession runtime events; the timeline is never used to rebuild provider history.

The UI presents:

- user messages,
- assistant output (markdown-lite, escape-first),
- collapsible reasoning when available (full content preserved; `summary` presentation labeled),
- tool calls (collapsible, long inputs folded),
- tool results (with backend badge taken only from event metadata: browser / browser-direct / edge-relay / cloud),
- workspace state (composer chip + rail, mount = real session boundary),
- errors and warnings,
- busy/cancel state (composer Cancel button + Escape),
- telemetry in the context rail.

The original V0.4 seams have since advanced: file uploads are mounted read-only at `/mnt/upload`; image attachments have a durable integrity-checked store and provider capability gate; conversations/provider-native replay state persist across reload through IndexedDB; `/home/locus` is durable through OPFS when available. The terminal drawer remains deliberately reserved and not wired.

### JavaScript userland runtime

Add isolated JavaScript execution.

Requirements:

- dedicated Web Worker,
- no model-controlled eval in the application UI context,
- no direct access to DOM, API keys, application globals, or session state,
- explicit bridge for permitted inputs/outputs,
- lifecycle timeout and recovery semantics comparable to Python.

### Deterministic edit capability

Add deterministic file editing/state mutation.

Initial semantic operations may include:

- read,
- write,
- replace exact text,
- insert,
- delete/rename where appropriate.

Deterministic edits should fail clearly when a requested match is absent or ambiguous.

The final decision on whether edit is exposed as a shell compatibility command or a structured tool should be based on model reliability, not aesthetics.

## Core capability boundary

The current core boundary is intentionally small.

```
Model-visible tools:
  bash
  cloud_bash   (unconfigured legacy/escalation stub)

Browser substrate:
  Execution
  Filesystem
  Network
  Perception

Current local userland:
  Python
  curl / HTTP
  bounded Unix-like file/text commands

Extension/product layer:
  Capability
    -> Plugin (code)
    -> Skill (knowledge)
    -> MCP (authority)
```

There is **no current model-facing `edit` tool** and no JavaScript shell command. Deterministic editing and a JS userland runtime remain possible future providers, but documentation must not describe them as implemented.

A new core proposal must explain why it cannot be expressed through execution + filesystem + network + perception, a Plugin, a Skill, MCP, or another explicit provider boundary.

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/CAPABILITY-BOUNDARIES.md`.

## V0.5 — Extension layer

Goal: allow the system to grow without expanding the core tool surface.

### Capability composition runtime v1

Status: implemented (`src/extensions.js`; unit coverage in
`tests/capability-composition.test.cjs` and `tests/skill-instances.test.cjs`,
browser coverage in `tests/e2e-capabilities.cjs` and
`tests/e2e-skill-instances.cjs`).

The user-facing product concept is the **Capability**: a composition of Plugins
(code), Skills (knowledge) and MCP requirements (authority). Implemented:

- [x] descriptor validators + validated catalog sets (invalid trusted catalogs fail loudly at load),
- [x] CapabilityManager with enable/disable, shared-component dedupe (reference semantics, not naive booleans), and the four capability states (`disabled` / `needs-connection` / `ready` / `error`),
- [x] immutable TaskEnvironment snapshots bound per agent task (UI mutations affect only the next task),
- [x] SkillDefinition = immutable publisher METADATA (inline source fields rejected at validation); the default Markdown source lives in a separate SkillSourceStore, keyed by skillId + version,
- [x] durable capability-private SkillInstances at `/home/locus/.skills/<capability-id>/<skill-id>.skill` with a Harness-owned install marker (written last), rollback on partial installs, reload/re-enable reuse and Remove = reset; shared definitions materialize per capability and are NEVER deduped,
- [x] compact system-prompt capability index pointing at the capability-private instance paths (only present instances; bodies never pre-injected),
- [x] read-only introspection mounts: `/mnt/plugins/<id>/plugin.json`, `/usr/local/share/locus/capabilities/<id>/capability.json` (the old read-only skill body mount is gone — instances are the one working view),
- [x] SkillInstanceWorkspace: the task-bound approval-guarded view of `/home/locus/.skills` — reads free; every create/write/delete (echo redirect, `>>`, curl -o, rm, python write-back commit) suspends on a `confirmation` approval with a harness-built diff, TOCTOU re-verification and cancellation; `mv` involving a skill instance and `rm -r` of a capability skill directory are refused outright,
- [x] PluginRuntimeProvider seam + python plugin lifecycle (pre-READY install + smoke import; ordinary import afterwards, no lazy-install-on-import; F04a/b/c boundaries untouched),
- [x] MCP requirement semantics with explicit connection state (never auto-authorized, never disguised as ready),
- [x] Settings UI: Capabilities list with Add/Remove (two-step destructive confirm stating that removing deletes customized guidance and re-adding restores defaults), component counts, connection-required state.

The production catalogs are EMPTY by design: no product capability (spreadsheet,
DOCX, PDF, GitHub, ...) has been decided. All v1 proofs use TEST-ONLY synthetic
descriptors injected via the manager constructor / e2e seam.

### Documentation / terminology foundation

Status: implemented.

The repository now has a wiki-style documentation index and explicit design contracts for architecture, terminology, runtime lifecycle, security, extensions, and testing. `docs/` is the normative documentation source; audit snapshots and candidate plugin studies are explicitly non-normative.

### Trusted Plugin Runtime v1

Status: v1A (offline wheel bootstrap primitive) implemented; v1B
(CapabilityManager artifact refs + production artifact store) is the next
extension-layer milestone.

v1A — implemented:

- verified wheel bytes delivered as trusted-harness payload (never a
  bootstrap-manifest asset), validated and own-copied by
  `PythonRuntime.configureExtensions` before any boot send;
- worker re-verifies exact size + SHA-256 (WebCrypto) before install;
- OFFLINE installation into a fresh runtime before READY: micropip +
  `emfs:` + `deps=False`, measured on the pinned Pyodide 0.26.4 inside the
  strict-CSP in-memory bootstrap environment;
- the exact micropip closure declared by the pinned pyodide-lock.json
  (`micropip-0.6.0`, `packaging-23.2`) joined the F04c bootstrap manifest
  with full provenance (release lockfile byte-compare + jsDelivr
  cross-check + `scripts/verify-python-bootstrap-manifest.mjs`);
- smoke import before task execution; bootstrap installer retired before
  READY (`micropip.install` denial; remote/index/local installs and
  `pyodide.loadPackage*` all dead with zero requests);
- verified cache/rebuild semantics: crash, reset and cancellation rebuild
  from the same configured payload with zero network; a cancellation inside
  the boot-reply window aborts the boot (never a late zombie READY);
- coverage: `tests/python-plugin-runtime.test.cjs` +
  `tests/e2e-python-plugin-runtime.cjs` (request-counter oracles).

v1B — pending:

- CapabilityManager artifact refs (`PluginRuntimeProvider` wheel loader);
- PluginArtifactStore production integration;
- TaskEnvironment stays metadata-only (v1A already keeps wheel bytes out
  of it);
- removal/isolation of the LEGACY SYNTHETIC COMPOSITION PATH
  (`files: {sourceText}`).

Standing v1 contract (unchanged): no Plugin/Python network authority; no
marketplace, arbitrary remote manifests, PyPI resolver, or model-triggered
install; synthetic wheel first; no production package/capability decision
until the loader contract is proven. The deterministic synthetic wheel
fixture lives at
`tests/fixtures/capability-package/minimal/plugins/locus-test-plugin/artifacts/`
(regenerable via `tests/fixtures/capability-package/tools/build-wheel.py`,
stdlib only) and its bundle-side identity (`size` + `sha256`) comes from
the package core.

### Capability package / authoring framework

Status: package core implemented (`src/capability-package.js`; coverage in
`tests/capability-package.test.cjs`); import UI, imported-package registry and runtime integration pending.

Goal: make a Capability an independently authorable/importable project rather
than something that requires source edits to Locus.

Planned contract:

- editable Capability Project layout; [implemented]
- strict validator over manifests/component graph/authority; [implemented]
- deterministic builder that generates size + SHA-256 lock metadata; [implemented]
- page-session imported-package registry for v1;
- explicit user import/trust transition;
- no runtime source edits or test-only catalog injection;
- same authoring flow for humans and Locus.

### Reference Capability E2E

Status: pending after Trusted Plugin Runtime + authoring/import infrastructure.

Use a deliberately small deterministic local capability (working reference:
`reference-text-analysis`) to prove:

```
source -> validate -> build -> import -> enable
       -> read Skill -> import real Plugin -> complete task
       -> customize Skill -> next-task effect
       -> Remove -> re-add defaults
```

This is infrastructure proof, not the first product Capability.

### Capability Authoring Capability / self-hosting

Status: pending after Reference Capability closure.

Target: a `capability-authoring` Capability composed from a deterministic local
authoring SDK Plugin plus a Skill that explains the design workflow.

Final acceptance:

> Starting from a plain-language request and an empty Capability project
> directory, Locus produces a valid bundle. After explicit user import, a
> subsequent task uses it successfully with no manual runtime-source edits.

Self-hosting never grants the model authority to auto-install its own generated
code.

### Capability registry (resolved design)

Status: implemented as the Capability Composition v1 registry/manager model described above. It provides the provider-neutral description of available capabilities and dependencies.

The registry should support:

- availability,
- required substrate capabilities,
- runtime/provider,
- authority level,
- optional dependencies,
- capability discovery.

### Plugins

Plugins add implementation code or libraries above the runtime substrate.

Examples:

- openpyxl,
- python-docx,
- Pillow,
- BeautifulSoup,
- DuckDB-WASM,
- ffmpeg.wasm,
- future WASM compilers.

The first plugin system should be intentionally small. Do not start with a marketplace.

### Skills

Skills add task knowledge and composition guidance without adding authority.
The v1 data model is closed (see `docs/CAPABILITY-BOUNDARIES.md` section 11):

- **SkillDefinition** = the publisher's immutable metadata template
  (id, version, display name, description). No inline source, ever.
- **SkillSourceStore** = the trusted default Markdown per
  `(skillId, version)`; future production sources arrive via build-time
  bundling, never runtime fetches.
- **SkillInstance** = a capability-private durable working copy at
  `/home/locus/.skills/<capability-id>/<skill-id>.skill`. Definitions may
  be shared; instances are NEVER shared. Reads are free; every
  create/write/delete needs an explicit user confirmation (a behavior
  mutation), and removing a capability deletes its instances — re-adding
  restores the defaults.

Examples:

- safe Excel editing,
- document template workflows,
- repository modification workflow,
- validation strategies.

### MCP

MCP adds external authority, durable remote state, credentials, or structured access to remote systems. Durable/shared RAG belongs naturally here; ephemeral local retrieval may remain Plugin + Skill composition.

Examples:

- GitHub,
- email,
- Slack,
- Jira,
- Notion,
- databases,
- enterprise APIs.

MCP credentials and permissions must remain explicit.

## Later milestones

These are deliberately not scheduled into the current core work.

### Cloud execution provider

Implement cloud_bash only when there is a real workload that cannot be expressed by the browser/local runtime.

The cloud backend should be an escalation provider, not the default execution environment.

### Rendering and visual QA

Document/image rendering may become a capability provider or plugin-backed workflow.

Potential uses:

- DOCX/PDF visual verification,
- screenshot-based artifact QA,
- chart/document layout validation.

### Browser automation

Authenticated browser interaction, DOM control, cookies, and user-session automation form a different authority boundary from public curl access.

If implemented, it should be treated as its own capability seam rather than quietly added to curl.

### Native/WASM ecosystem

Native tools such as ffmpeg, LibreOffice, or compilers should not become core simply because they are useful.

Possible future implementations include:

- WASM plugins,
- WebContainer-style providers,
- MCP services,
- cloud execution providers,
- community-maintained adapters.

The core should keep the path open without implementing every environment itself.
