# Locus Capability Boundaries

> Repository evolution: [Runtime / Harness / Product split](REPOSITORY-SPLIT.md) defines the agreed target ownership, independent repositories and migration gates. The split is not yet implemented; current behavior below remains the baseline.

> This document defines what belongs in the browser runtime, what belongs in the harness, and what should stay outside the core.

## 1. The target machine

Locus is not a Linux kernel emulator. It is a **Unix-like agent userland inside a browser tab**.

The model-visible tool registry on current `main` is deliberately tiny:

```
bash
cloud_bash
```

`bash` is the real local browser-machine interface. `cloud_bash` is an unconfigured legacy/escalation stub and is **not** a network fallback. There is currently no separate `edit` tool and no JavaScript shell command.

Inside `bash`, the supported registry is discoverable with `help` and currently includes `pwd`, `cd`, `ls`, `cat`, `echo`, `find`, `grep`, `head`, `tail`, `wc`, `sort`, `mv`, `rm`, `python`, `curl`, `which`, and `help`.

The design rule is:

> **Do not make the model learn Locus. Make Locus look like a small, honest computer.**

## 2. Four substrate capabilities

The browser machine is easier to reason about as four substrate capabilities. These are architectural categories, not four model tools.

### 2.1 Execution

Execution runs local userland computation.

Current implementation: Python through Pyodide in a strict-CSP worker. JavaScript/WASM execution may be added through explicit providers or Plugins later; documentation must not present them as current shell runtimes.

Python user code has no direct network authority. The trusted harness acquires and integrity-verifies the fixed Pyodide bootstrap set, then the worker runs with browser-enforced network denial.

### 2.2 Filesystem

Filesystem provides local state and file authority through one Linux-like VFS namespace.

Current important paths include:

- `/home/locus` — local home, durable through OPFS when available;
- `/home/locus/.skills/<capability>/<skill>.skill` — capability-private mutable SkillInstances;
- `/mnt/workspace` — optional user-authorized external directory;
- `/mnt/upload` — explicit user uploads, read-only to the agent;
- `/mnt/download` — writable artifacts exposed for user download;
- `/tmp` — ephemeral scratch;
- `/usr/bin` and `/bin` — virtual views derived from the live shell registry.

Shell and Python use the same model-visible paths. Python may use snapshot/diff internally; that is an implementation detail, not another filesystem namespace.

### 2.3 Network

Network provides bounded HTTP/HTTPS request/response through `NetworkRuntime`.

GET/HEAD are read-like. Supported side-effecting methods are approval-gated and dispatched exactly once; ambiguous failures are never retried across backends. Routing between browser-direct and the optional `/fetch` relay belongs to the harness, not the model.

Python itself cannot open network connections; network work goes through the outer `curl`/NetworkRuntime path today.

### 2.4 Perception

Perception is the model-input boundary for non-text user data. It is not a shell command and it does not add filesystem or network authority.

Current implementation is image input:

```
user image
  -> local attachment store
  -> provider/model capability lookup
  -> human decision or isolated probe when unknown
  -> materialize provider-native image input only at request time
```

The image capability registry in `src/capabilities.js` answers a provider/model compatibility question. It is distinct from the **user-facing Capability composition registry** in `src/extensions.js`. The shared word “capability” describes two different layers; do not conflate them.

See `IMAGE-INPUT.md`.

## 3. Model-facing interface vs substrate

```
                         Agent
                    /             \
             model input          tools
                 |                 |
            Perception            bash
                                   |
                         compatibility userland
                         /        |        \
                       VFS      Python    curl
                        |         |         |
                   Filesystem  Execution  Network
```

The model should learn ordinary task semantics and ordinary paths, not backend topology. The harness decides whether a filesystem operation maps to memory, OPFS, or a user-granted directory, and whether HTTP is direct or relayed.


## 4. Runtime responsibilities

The runtime layer should provide the smallest reliable machine substrate necessary for the Unix-like interface.

It is responsible for:

- execution isolation,
- filesystem authority and synchronization,
- network routing and relay behavior,
- resource limits,
- cancellation,
- telemetry at the machine-capability boundary,
- backend/provider selection,
- transparent escalation where allowed.

It should not contain domain-specific business logic.

Examples that do **not** belong in the runtime core by default:

- Excel editing workflows,
- DOCX workflows,
- RAG pipelines,
- GitHub operations,
- email operations,
- ffmpeg-specific agent tools,
- LibreOffice-specific agent tools,
- compiler-specific agent tools,
- database-specific agent tools.

A runtime provider may implement a machine capability differently without changing the higher-level interface.

For example:

```
ShellService
  +-- BrowserShellProvider
  +-- future CloudShellProvider
```

or:

```
NetworkService
  +-- BrowserDirectProvider
  +-- EdgeRelayProvider
  +-- future other provider
```

## 5. Harness responsibilities

The harness composes capabilities into useful agent behavior.

It owns:

- the agent loop,
- model/provider protocol adaptation,
- capability discovery,
- tool and runtime orchestration,
- session state,
- permissions/approval boundaries,
- extension loading,
- Skills,
- Plugins,
- MCP integration,
- event delivery to the UI.

The harness should compose the machine; it should not continuously expand the machine's primitive set.

## 6. Extension boundaries

A useful rule is:

> **Capability composes them for the user.**  
> **Plugin adds code.**  
> **Skill adds knowledge.**  
> **MCP adds authority.**

The user operates on **Capabilities**, never on the internal components. A Capability
is a named bundle of local code (Plugins), on-demand knowledge (Skills) and external
authority requirements (MCP). Advanced UI may expand the components for inspection,
but the components are the internal composition — not three separate user-facing
configuration systems.

### 6.1 Plugin: code

Plugins provide implementation code, libraries, packages or local runtime capabilities.

Examples:

- openpyxl,
- python-docx,
- Pillow,
- BeautifulSoup,
- DuckDB-WASM,
- ffmpeg.wasm,
- a WASM compiler,
- a local embedding library.

A Plugin should normally reuse the existing execution/filesystem/network substrate.

Installing a library should not automatically create a new domain-specific core tool.

### 6.2 Skill: knowledge

Skills teach the model how to compose existing capabilities.

Examples:

- safely edit an Excel workbook,
- modify a DOCX template,
- inspect a repository before editing,
- perform a research workflow,
- choose when to use Python vs JavaScript,
- validate an artifact after modification.

Skills do not grant authority.

A Skill can depend on Plugins and MCP capabilities.

### 6.3 MCP: authority

MCP is appropriate when the agent needs external authority, durable remote state, credentials, or an auditable external action boundary.

Examples:

- GitHub,
- Gmail,
- Slack,
- Jira,
- Notion,
- enterprise APIs,
- databases,
- durable vector stores,
- authenticated retrieval systems.

MCP should be a first-class harness capability. It may have a shell/CLI compatibility frontend, but it should not be forced through stringly-typed bash commands because credentials, schemas, approvals and side effects deserve structured handling.

## 7. RAG boundary

RAG is not a runtime primitive.

There are two useful cases.

### 7.1 Ephemeral local retrieval

If the task is local and temporary, retrieval can be assembled from ordinary machine capabilities.

Examples:

- grep/ripgrep-like search,
- BM25 over current workspace files,
- local chunking,
- a temporary embedding index,
- a Plugin-provided local vector library.

This belongs to Plugin + Skill composition over bash/filesystem/compute.

### 7.2 Durable or external retrieval

If retrieval uses:

- a persistent vector database,
- shared organizational knowledge,
- remote embeddings,
- authenticated data,
- durable cross-session indexes,
- enterprise permissions,

it belongs naturally behind MCP or another explicit external-authority provider.

In both cases, Locus core does not need a `rag_search` primitive.

## 8. Internet is a machine capability, not just a curl command

The current implementation exposes browser Internet access primarily through `curl`.

That is an implementation stage, not the final abstraction.

The target is for programs running under bash to reuse the same network capability where practical:

```
python script
  -> requests/httpx/urllib
  -> Locus network bridge
  -> direct browser request or relay

javascript
  -> fetch-compatible bridge
  -> Locus network bridge

curl
  -> Locus network bridge
```

This preserves the Unix illusion: a model may write a normal Python program with multiple HTTP requests instead of manually decomposing every request into separate outer tool calls.

If browser constraints require an internal RPC, HTTP shim or relay, that is a runtime implementation detail.

## 9. Escalation boundaries

Some workloads cannot be faithfully implemented inside a browser tab.

Examples may include:

- native Linux binaries with no practical WASM port,
- raw TCP/UDP requirements,
- heavyweight compilation,
- large memory/CPU workloads,
- CUDA/GPU workloads,
- long-running daemons,
- privileged OS APIs,
- some desktop rendering stacks,
- full browser automation with authenticated sessions.

These should trigger an explicit capability/provider boundary:

- Plugin/WASM where feasible,
- MCP for external authority/services,
- browser automation capability when appropriate,
- future `cloud_bash` for a genuine remote computer.

The 1% exception should not force the other 99% of lightweight tasks into a cloud sandbox.

## 10. Admission rule for new core capabilities

Before adding a new core capability, ask:

1. Can this be expressed as execution + filesystem + network + perception?
2. Can a Plugin provide the missing code?
3. Can a Skill provide the missing workflow knowledge?
4. Is the missing piece actually external authority and therefore MCP?
5. Is it genuinely a machine capability unavailable in the current runtime?
6. Does it require a new permission boundary?

If the answer is simply "this domain would be convenient to have as a dedicated tool", it probably does not belong in core.

## 11. Capability composition runtime (v1, implemented)

The composition layer exists (`src/extensions.js`, `tests/capability-composition.test.cjs`,
`tests/skill-instances.test.cjs`, `tests/e2e-capabilities.cjs`,
`tests/e2e-skill-instances.cjs`). It is architecture + mechanism only: the PRODUCTION
catalogs are deliberately empty, and no product capability (spreadsheet, DOCX, PDF,
GitHub, ...) is decided yet. Everything proven below uses TEST-ONLY synthetic
descriptors injected through the manager constructor / e2e seam.

### 11.1 Objects

```
CapabilityRegistry / PluginRegistry / SkillRegistry
      (one validated catalog set per CapabilityManager; skill entries are
       METADATA ONLY — default sources live in the SkillSourceStore;
       invalid trusted catalogs FAIL LOUDLY at load — never
       skip-and-continue)
CapabilityManager
      enable / disable / setMcpState / listCapabilities
      resolves + dedupes plugins and MCP requirements by id (shared
      components stay active while ANY enabled capability references
      them); materializes capability-PRIVATE durable skill instances
      (never deduped — one per capability × declared skill)
TaskEnvironment
      immutable per-task snapshot built by the harness at task start:
      { capabilities, plugins (+ prepared payloads), skill INSTANCES
        (metadata + capability-private path + present, never a body),
        mcps, pythonExtensionKey } — deeply frozen
SkillInstanceWorkspace
      the task-bound approval-guarded view of /home/locus/.skills
      mounted on task forks (reads free; mutations ask every time)
```

```
User enables Capability
        |
CapabilityManager.resolve
        |
Plugins + MCP requirements   (deduped by id)
Skills -> per-capability durable instances (materialize or reuse marker)
        |
TaskEnvironment snapshot (frozen)
        |
AgentSession (per task: workspace binding + TaskEnvironment binding)
```

Capability states: `disabled` (not added), `needs-connection` (enabled locally, an
MCP authority is not connected), `ready` (all required components available),
`error` (local resolution failed — e.g. a plugin runtime whose provider is missing).
`needs-connection` is never disguised as `ready`.

### 11.2 Plugin semantics (v1)

- Descriptor authority is ALWAYS `none`; any other authority is rejected at
  validation. Plugins never gain network, browser-credential, DOM, API-key,
  arbitrary parent-RPC or MCP authority.
- `PluginRuntimeProvider` is the generic runtime seam
  (`prepare(plugin, context) -> { files, imports }`); python / javascript / wasm
  are recognized runtimes, but v1 exercises exactly one provider kind (python,
  tests only). A future verified wheel loader plugs in here without touching the
  Capability / Skill / Agent model.
- Python plugin lifecycle: TaskEnvironment snapshot -> harness configures
  the payload -> Python worker boots -> all enabled plugin modules installed
  into site-packages -> smoke import -> READY. After that, `import <module>`
  works like any preinstalled package. There is NO lazy-install-on-import, no
  runtime download, no retry loop. A broken payload fails the boot closed.
- Two payload transports exist (TPR v1A): the TRUSTED WHEEL PAYLOAD
  (`wheels: [{filename, format, size, sha256, bytes}]`, worker re-verifies
  byte identity, installs OFFLINE via micropip `emfs:` + `deps=False` from a
  `/tmp` scratch path, then retires the installer) and the LEGACY SYNTHETIC
  COMPOSITION PATH (`files: {sourceText}` — the composition proof, not
  Trusted Plugin Runtime artifact delivery; v1B removes/isolates it).
  Both ride the bootstrap MESSAGE (post-`loadPackage`, pre-lockdown); the
  F04c `PYTHON_BOOTSTRAP_MANIFEST` trust boundary carries only the pinned
  micropip installer closure — never a plugin wheel. A boot-reply-window
  cancellation/reset aborts the boot: a cancelled boot can never turn READY.

### 11.3 Skill semantics (v1): definitions, sources, mutable instances

The skill data model has three separate concepts:

```
SkillDefinition   = publisher's immutable METADATA template
                    { id, version, displayName, description } — and nothing
                    else. Inline source fields (body / content / markdown /
                    inlineSource / path) are REJECTED at validation.
SkillSourceStore  = the trusted default Markdown per (skillId, version).
                    Separate from the metadata registry. Production stays
                    empty; future production sources arrive via build-time
                    bundling (raw import into the store), never a runtime
                    fetch. file:// keeps working: nothing fetches skills.
SkillInstance     = a capability-PRIVATE durable working copy at
                    /home/locus/.skills/<capability-id>/<skill-id>.skill.
                    The path IS the identity (capabilityId + skillId).
```

**Definitions may be shared. Instances are NEVER shared.** The same
definition referenced by two capabilities materializes two independent
files (byte-identical at first install, freely divergent afterwards);
TaskEnvironment carries one entry per capability × skill — never deduped
(plugins and MCP requirements still dedupe by id).

Instance lifecycle (enable = materialize, disable = reset):

- **Install marker**: `/home/locus/.skills/<capability-id>/.locus-installed.json`
  records capabilityId, capabilityVersion and each skill's
  id/sourceVersion/sourceHash. It is written LAST, after every default
  instance materialized and was verified. It is Harness-owned: hidden from
  shell listings, refused for every agent write/delete (including python
  write-backs).
- **First install**: create the directory, write all defaults, verify,
  write the marker. Any failure ROLLS BACK the whole first install — no
  half-installed state can ever "look enabled" (enable reports state
  `error`).
- **Marker present + compatible** (same capability version, same source
  versions/hashes) → REUSE: user customizations and deliberate deletions
  survive re-enables AND page reloads. Capability enabled-state stays
  page-session only, but instances are durable OPFS files.
- **Marker present + incompatible** → enable fails loudly with state
  `error`; user skills are never auto-overwritten (a future upgrade/merge
  path is out of scope for v1).
- **Marker absent** → incomplete install: leftovers are cleaned and the
  defaults rebuilt.
- **Remove Capability** deletes the ENTIRE capability skill directory,
  then disables the capability — customizations included. Re-adding
  rematerializes from the immutable definitions. This is the v1
  "restore defaults" path. Removal is an explicit user UI action (two-step
  destructive confirm; no Agent ApprovalCard is involved), and a failed
  deletion leaves the capability enabled with a visible error — it is
  never reported as removed.

### 11.3b Agent mutations of skill instances (approval contract)

Skill instances are guidance the agent can CUSTOMIZE — a behavior
mutation, a higher-risk class than ordinary workspace writes:

- **READ: free.** `cat`, `ls` (marker hidden) and stat need no approval.
- **CREATE / WRITE / DELETE: an explicit `confirmation` approval EVERY
  time** (outcome confirm/cancel; no session grant exists for this kind;
  no-op writes with identical bytes do not ask).
- The gate is centralized in `SkillInstanceWorkspace`, a task-bound VFS
  provider mounted at `/home/locus/.skills` on every task fork whose
  environment carries skills. Shell redirects (`>`, `>>`), `curl -o`,
  `rm <file>` and python write-back commits all funnel through the same
  guard — never through per-command checks.
- The approval card shows the harness-computed identity (Capability /
  Skill / Path) and a real line diff of the change; deletes spell out that
  the file stays absent until recreated or the capability is removed and
  re-added. Oversized changes fail closed (files ≤ 256 KiB UTF-8, diffs
  bounded) instead of showing a truncated diff. Binary skills are refused.
- **TOCTOU**: the approved diff is applied only if the file's current
  hash still matches the before-state hashed when the approval opened;
  otherwise the mutation is refused as a conflict. The task AbortSignal is
  re-checked after the decision and again before the side effect; task
  cancellation cancels a pending confirmation.
- **Identity check**: a task may only mutate skills declared by a
  capability in ITS OWN TaskEnvironment snapshot (exact path match).
  Undeclared skill ids, foreign capability directories, the skills root,
  install markers, `mkdir`, directory removals, `mv` involving a skill
  instance and `rm -r` of a capability skill directory all fail closed
  without any mutation (`mv`/`rm -r` at the shell layer, the rest in the
  guard).
- **Python changeset honesty**: when a python run mixes ordinary writes
  and skill mutations, a declined skill change is reported as a `[conflict:
  …]` refusal — ordinary paths still commit, and the run reports partial
  persistence instead of a fake success.
- The system prompt advertises only PRESENT instance paths (a deleted
  skill drops out of the index; the capability stays listed — guidance
  absence is a customization, not a runtime error) and carries one compact
  rule: capability guidance under `~/.skills` may be customized when the
  user asks for future behavior changes, and such mutations require
  explicit user confirmation from Locus.
- Skill bodies still NEVER enter the TaskEnvironment or the system
  prompt, and mutable SkillInstance contents persist only as
  capability-private durable files under `/home/locus/.skills`: the
  model reads a guidance file with `cat` when — and only when — the task
  needs it, and the body then enters history as ordinary tool output
  inside the existing `HISTORY_BUDGET_BYTES` accounting (lazy loading is
  the token-budget feature). Workspace files, uploads and URLs can never
  become or shadow a skill: only declared instance paths are mutable, and
  even a model acting on injected file content hits the confirmation gate.

### 11.4 MCP semantics (v1)

- A capability references MCP requirements by id; the requirement state
  (`connected` / `needs-connection` / `unavailable`) lives in the manager.
- Enabling a capability NEVER authorizes anything. Until an explicit connection
  decision, requirements are `needs-connection`; the system prompt says the
  authority is NOT available. No connector, transport, OAuth or credential
  storage exists in v1.

### 11.5 Snapshot + VFS semantics

- `AgentSession.run(text, { workspace, taskEnvironment })` binds BOTH immutably
  per task. UI enable/disable mutates the manager only; a running task keeps
  its snapshot; changes apply to the NEXT `buildTaskEnvironment()`. The
  snapshot freezes instance IDENTITY (capabilityId + skillId + path), not
  file content: an approved in-task mutation changes the file, never the
  frozen object, and the next build re-observes `present`.
- Per-task VFS forks mount: `/mnt/plugins/<id>/plugin.json` (safe descriptor
  introspection), `/usr/local/share/locus/capabilities/<id>/capability.json`
  (resolved safe metadata + state) and — when the environment carries
  skills — the guarded `SkillInstanceWorkspace` at `/home/locus/.skills`
  (read-write authority, every mutation approval-gated). There is
  deliberately NO second read-only skill view: the old
  `/usr/local/share/locus/skills` body mount is gone, so exactly one
  working view of each skill exists. An empty environment mounts nothing.

### 11.6 Deliberately not in v1

No real product capabilities, no marketplace / remote manifests / plugin store,
no MCP connector or OAuth, no PyPI / micropip / wheel-solver commitment, no
persistent capability preferences (page-session only; reload resets), no new
model-facing tools (`AGENT_TOOL_DEFINITIONS` stays bash + cloud_bash), no
skill upgrade/migration or three-way merge (incompatible markers fail loudly
and the reset path is Remove + Re-add), no per-skill "Restore default" button,
no remote skill download or arbitrary user skill install.

### 11.7 Capability package core (v1, implemented)

`src/capability-package.js` adds the AUTHORING/PACKAGE boundary described
in [CAPABILITY-PACKAGE.md](CAPABILITY-PACKAGE.md) section 2b: a source
project (strict manifest schemas + graph + authority + bounds + path
rules) validates into structured diagnostics, builds into an immutable
logical `CapabilityBundle` (builder-computed size + SHA-256, canonical
deterministic lock, copy-out byte reads) and inspects into a safe plain
summary. Validation and build are READ ONLY and install NOTHING: no
catalog mutation, no plugin install, no skill materialization, no
registration. The production catalogs stay empty; the module ships no
production package - only TEST-ONLY fixtures under
`tests/fixtures/capability-package/`.

Locus is not a collection of browser tools.

> **Locus is a Unix-like execution substrate for agents, implemented inside a browser tab.**

The browser is the default machine. The harness composes it. Extensions add code, knowledge and authority. Heavier computers are escalation providers, not the starting point.
