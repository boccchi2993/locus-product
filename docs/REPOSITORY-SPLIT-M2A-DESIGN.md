# Repository split M2a — Runtime independence: symbol-level design

Status: M2a design record (written before implementation). Base: `refactor/repository-split-m1b` @ `83fdfbb` (PR #4 head, verified unchanged; PRs #2/#3/#4 all OPEN at branch creation, none merged). Contract basis: [REPOSITORY-SPLIT-CONTRACTS.md](REPOSITORY-SPLIT-CONTRACTS.md) §3.1/§3.5/§3.6/§3.7/§3.8, inventory [REPOSITORY-SPLIT-INVENTORY.md](REPOSITORY-SPLIT-INVENTORY.md) §2/§3/§4 step 3.

M2a scope (per INVENTORY §4 step 3 + the phase brief): Runtime packaging and the public entry — worker sources as Runtime-owned modules, `#sb-python` write → status events, `LOCUS_HOME_SKELETON` as an argument, `EXTENSION_*` patterns as Runtime contract data, `ConversationHistoryWorkspace` moved to Product files, `createRuntime → RuntimeHost → RuntimeSession` landed, `prepare` waits for in-flight executions at the session layer, Product rewired through the public entry, independence gates A–G. M2b (Harness port injection: `describeCommands`, ToolPort split, Telemetry sink) and M3 (repository extraction) are explicitly OUT of scope.

## 1. Public entry and minimal configuration

New module `src/runtime/index.js` (ESM — the only new always-bundled surface):

```
createRuntime(opts: {
  workerAssets: { pyWorkerSource: string, grepWorkerSource: string }   // required, non-empty strings
}) → RuntimeHost

RuntimeHost = {
  contractVersion: 1
  capabilities(): { executionKinds: ['shell','python'],
                    bootstrap: { shaPinned: true, assetCount, totalBytes },
                    policyMechanisms: ['mutationPolicy', 'authorization'] }
  createSession(opts = {}) → RuntimeSession     // each session owns ONE interpreter instance
  dispose(reason?)                              // terminal: disposes every session (idempotent)
}

RuntimeSession = {
  prepare(req: { signal?: AbortSignal, python?: PluginPayload | null })
    → Promise<{ rebuiltInterpreter: boolean }>   // §4 below: waits for in-flight executions
  execute(req: { kind: 'shell' | 'python', input: string,
                 context: { filesystem, signal?, mutationPolicy?, authorization?, cwd? } })
    → Promise<result>                            // tool-shaped result + normalized `ok`
  status() → { interpreter, busyExecutions, extensionKey, disposed }
  onStatus(fn) → unsubscribe()                   // immediate snapshot on subscribe, then edges
  reset(reason?)                                 // session boundary (M1b instance semantics)
  dispose(reason?)                               // terminal, idempotent (M1b instance semantics)
}
```

Deviations from the CONTRACTS §3.1 draft, all intentional:

1. **No `cancelActiveExecutions`.** No current caller needs it: the harness cancels through the task signal (which the instance already honors) and session boundaries use `reset()`. At the instance level a cancel-all would BE `reset()` (reset invalidates queued work and pending requests, never rolls back committed effects, and preserves the configured payload). Added nothing that has no consumer.
2. **No `grep-regex` execution kind.** Grep is a shell command; there is no standalone grep execution today. The kinds are the real needs: `shell` and `python`.
3. **No session-pinned `filesystem`.** The product's model is fork-per-task (`session base .fork()` + task mounts); a base filesystem stored on the session would be unused hidden state. `context.filesystem` travels per request; it is OPTIONAL — when absent, the shell's accepted fallback applies (`asVfs` builds a fresh internal machine), so `execute` never invents a second rule where the runtime already has one.
4. **`authorization` instead of contract-draft `ExecutionAuthorization`-in-createSession.** The port arrives per request (like `mutationPolicy`) because it is task-scoped state (§5 below).
5. **`workerAssets`/`hosting`/`events` shrink to `workerAssets`.** Hosting context stays where it is today (`network.js` reads `window.location`; injecting it is NetworkRuntime work owned by the same file, not needed by the entry). Events are per-session subscriptions (`onStatus`), not a host-level sink object — the one consumer (UI status) is per-page-per-session.
6. **`pythonRuntime()` accessor on the session** — a Runtime-internal accessor returning the underlying interpreter instance, used ONLY by test/e2e seams (documented users: `window.__locus` seams, Node suites). The Product execution chain never touches it; it exists so tests can drive the SAME object the session drives, not a second one.

Import-time safety: importing `src/runtime/index.js` performs no DOM access, no worker spawn, no fetch. The entry resolves its runtime core at `createRuntime()` call time through TWO assembly modes over ONE implementation set (review round, §12): the declared Runtime-internal registry `globalThis.__LOCUS_RUNTIME_CORE__` (populated by `src/shell.js` at classic load) is DELEGATED to when present — a mixed page keeps exactly one copy of every core definition — and otherwise the entry dynamically imports the SAME five sources through `src/runtime/core.js` (one memoized import; the files publish their cross-file names explicitly for this mode). Merely not having preloaded the classic scripts is therefore NOT an error; a broken or partial registry, or missing worker assets, still is (A1c correction).

## 2. State ownership

| Owner | State |
|---|---|
| RuntimeHost | The `workerAssets` bundle (validated, frozen), the set of sessions it created, host disposal reason. Nothing else. |
| RuntimeSession | ONE `createPythonRuntime()` instance (all interpreter state stays inside it, M1b), the session's status-listener set, the prepare serialization tail, session disposal reason. |
| Task execution context (per `execute` call) | `filesystem` (the caller's task VFS), `signal`, `mutationPolicy`, `authorization`, `cwd`. Held for the call only; never stored on the session. |
| Product (unchanged) | Page VFS + mounts, task forks, approval controller, capability manager, relay config, the ONE host+session created at first use. |

The canonical interpreter instance MOVES from the store into `RuntimeSession` (contract §3.4-Q3 target shape). Preparation (`session.prepare`), session boundaries (`session.reset`) and execution (internal injection into `runShellCommand`/`runPythonCode`) can never split onto two interpreters — the session owns the only reference that matters.

Instance-per-task is explicitly rejected: sessions keep M1b lazy boot; a text-only task constructs nothing and downloads nothing.

## 3. Worker and Python assets (couples #1 removal)

- New `src/runtime/worker-assets.js` (ESM): `PY_WORKER_SOURCE`, `GREP_WORKER_SOURCE` — the exact sources migrated verbatim out of `index.html` (`#py-worker-src` / `#grep-worker-src` blocks deleted). Encoding: per-line JSON-escaped strings in an array joined with `\n` (the sources contain backticks and backslashes; this form is mechanically safe and keeps 1:1 reviewable lines). A syntax gate (`new Function(src)` in the worker suites) pins that each string still parses as a worker script.
- `createPythonRuntime(opts)` takes `{ pyWorkerSource }` (required, non-empty string, validated at construction). `_ensureWorker` uses the stored source; the `document.getElementById('py-worker-src')` read is DELETED — no DOM fallback, no CDN fallback, no cross-backend retry.
- `createGrepRegexSession(pattern, flags, workerSource)` takes the source; `shGrep` forwards `opts.grepWorkerSource`. `GrepRegexRuntime.createWorker(source)` uses the argument (the `_workerFactory` TEST-ONLY seam stays). The `#grep-worker-src` read is deleted.
- Creator iframe, strict CSP (`PY_CREATOR_CSP`), message identity checks, SHA-256 bootstrap verification, per-phase budgets and fail-closed boot failure handling: UNCHANGED.
- Asset ownership: sources are immutable strings shared by every session of a host; the verified Pyodide byte cache stays PER INSTANCE (M1b decision); instances dispose their own creator iframes/workers. The Product bundle ships the sources via the ESM import (Vite-bundled); the standalone host imports the same module — no page copies anything.

## 4. `prepare` waits for in-flight executions (session layer)

`RuntimeSession.prepare(req)`:

1. Refuse when disposed (the disposal reason) or when `req.signal` is already aborted (cancellation-shaped `AbortError`, M1b form preserved).
2. **Barrier**: capture the in-flight set = queued + active run entries of the instance (each entry now records its `done` promise, assigned synchronously at `run()` call time) and await `Promise.allSettled` over them, raced against `req.signal` abort. No timers, no busy polling, no retry.
3. **No late effect**: after the barrier, re-validate in order — disposed → throw the disposal reason; a `reset()`/`dispose()` landing during the wait (reset-generation changed since entry) → throw a boundary error, NOTHING applied; signal aborted during the wait → throw the cancellation-shaped refusal. Only then apply, synchronously, via the existing instance `prepare` (compare-key → validate-then-swap; unchanged M1b code).
4. Concurrent prepares serialize through a session-level tail chain (apply order = call order).

The instance-level `prepare` keeps its accepted synchronous contract (validate-then-swap, no awaits, all-or-nothing) — the waiting lives ONLY in the session wrapper. A killed-during-wait in-flight run still settles honestly at its own boundary (M1b generation semantics); the configuration that lost the race is never applied afterwards.

## 5. Execution authorization port (couples #6 removal)

`network.js` `request(spec)` consumes `spec.authorization = { request(req, opts) → Promise<{ outcome, scope }> }` with `req = { kind:'permission', action, resource, policyKey }` — the Runtime-defined consumer interface (contract §3.5). The `policyContext { approvals, conversationId, taskGeneration }` shape and the chat-identity field names are REMOVED from the Runtime: the approval request the Runtime constructs carries no identity; the PRODUCT adapter supplies identity on its side.

Product adapter (store): `productNetworkAuthorization()` closes over the CURRENT live conversation id + session generation per execution and forwards to `approvals.request({ ...req, conversationId, taskGeneration }, opts)` — byte-identical approval payloads downstream, so approval UI/persistence behavior is unchanged. Deny ≠ cancel, dispatch-once semantics, SSRF relay policy: unchanged.

`wiredToolExecutor` stops injecting `approvals/conversationId/taskGeneration/pythonRuntime` into tool opts; it injects `runtimeSession`, `mutationPolicy`, `authorization`. `SkillInstanceWorkspace` wiring in `prepareTask` keeps its direct Product→Product approvals reference (never crossed the Runtime boundary).

## 6. Remaining Runtime-internal packaging (declared, temporary)

`src/shell.js` stays a classic script until M3 (converting it would break the eval-based suite loading model of ~20 suites — that conversion belongs to repository extraction). To make the entry genuinely importable instead of a wrapper of *implicit* globals, shell.js ends with ONE declared registration:

```
globalThis.__LOCUS_RUNTIME_CORE__ = Object.freeze({ createPythonRuntime, runShellCommand, runPythonCode,
                                                   VirtualWorkspace, SHELL_COMMANDS, ... })
```

The entry (and any host) resolves through this named seam when the page carries the classic copies; a host that carries none gets the entry's own self-assembly of the SAME sources (§12). Either way the boundary test (gate G) enforces that Runtime files reference ONLY this registry among globals and never any Harness/Product global, and gate G7 walks the entry's transitive import closure. The registry is not a second state holder: it is a frozen table of the same functions; the self-assembly chunk is code-split and never fetched on a registry page.

Contract data: the payload-identity patterns live IN `src/shell.js` as the Runtime's own constants (`RUNTIME_PLUGIN_ID_PATTERN` / `RUNTIME_PY_MODULE_PATTERN`, exported through the registry as `contract`) — the same module that enforces them, no extra classic file, no load-order cost (a separate `runtime/contract.js` classic script would have had to be threaded into every eval-based suite and page for zero gain; deviation from the earlier draft of this section). `src/extensions.js` keeps its Harness copy unchanged; a boundary test pins the two regex sources EQUAL (the declared synchronization mechanism).

## 7. Status events replace DOM writes and polling (couples #3 removal)

- `_setStatus(status)` updates `this.status` and emits to the instance's listener set; the `#sb-python` DOM write is DELETED.
- `RuntimeSession.onStatus(fn)`: invokes `fn(snapshot())` synchronously on subscribe (initial read; no missed-edge window), then on every change; returns an unsubscribe; observer exceptions are contained per listener (a throwing observer can never break execution, other observers, or cleanup); after `dispose`, listeners may receive the final transition; no events flow after unsubscribe.
- Events are instance-scoped: a stale instance's events reach only its own (unsubscribed) listeners — no cross-instance pollution by construction.
- Product: `main.js` subscribes once at boot and projects `snapshot.interpreter` into `store.pythonStatus`; the 1-second `setInterval` poll is DELETED. `ContextRail.vue` keeps reading the store projection (UI code untouched).
- Harness telemetry sink injection stays M2b (per brief §7); the Runtime adds no telemetry dependency in M2a.

## 8. Product globals removal (inventory §3 items 4, 7, 11)

1. **`LOCUS_HOME_SKELETON`**: `VirtualWorkspace` takes `opts.homeSkeleton` (array of relative dir paths). Default when omitted: `['.config', '.cache']` — neutral, non-Locus. The Product (store) passes `LOCUS_HOME_SKELETON` explicitly (Product→Product classic-global read, unchanged values, byte-identical VFS for Locus). Tests that pinned the old implicit fallback are updated to pass skeletons explicitly; new checks pin the neutral default.
2. **`EXTENSION_*` patterns**: Runtime contract data (§6). `shell.js` no longer references `extensions.js` globals — gate A's eval set (telemetry, workspace, vfs, network, shell, contract, entry) boots and configures payloads with zero Harness/Product files in scope.
3. **`MutationPolicy`**: stays a per-request port; the generic default (no policy) keeps accepted semantics (no refusal class). Unchanged from M1b except that it now travels through `session.execute` context.
4. **`ConversationHistoryWorkspace`**: moved verbatim from `src/workspace.js` to `src/conversation-history-workspace.js` (Product classic script; loads after `workspace.js`, copied by the build). The `service._byIndex` private read becomes Product-internal (same owner on both sides). `workspace.js` is Runtime-only afterwards.
5. **NetworkRuntime**: no code move (it is Runtime-owned); the authorization port (§5) is the boundary work. `Runtime 不导入 AgentSession 或产品会话状态` — unchanged and now enforced structurally (gate G).

## 9. Product wiring (no bypass)

`store.js` builds ONE host+session lazily (`hooks().runtimeSession` test seam → `createRuntime({ workerAssets })` → `host.createSession()`); drives `session.prepare/reset`; `executeTool` (Product tool router) executes bash through `session.execute` and REQUIRES the session (loud failure without — the old direct `runShellCommand` global path is no longer reachable from the product chain; runtime suites test `runShellCommand` directly as the internal implementation). `window.__locus.runtime()` replaces `window.__locus.pythonRuntime()` as the e2e seam (same underlying object via the documented accessor). Every transition seam is one-way delegation with no second state.

## 10. Independence gates (brief §10 mapping)

- **A** `tests/runtime-standalone.test.mjs`: import entry+assets with NO other file loaded (no DOM); then eval ONLY runtime files → VFS + shell + python-instance construction + status events run; python never starts (fetch/document asserts).
- **B** `tests/runtime-host.html` (vite build input → `dist/tests/runtime-host.html`) + `tests/e2e-runtime-host.cjs`: built-artifact host page runs grep (real worker) and real Python with zero `py-worker-src`/`grep-worker-src` DOM, cold-load downloads nothing.
- **C** two hosts/sessions in one page: status, execution, cancel, dispose stay independent (Node + browser).
- **D** prepare barrier suites: settle-wait, cancel-during-wait, reset-during-wait, dispose-during-wait, late-execution-vs-prepare ordering (Node, deterministic worker fixtures).
- **E** M1 lifecycle: `python-lifecycle`/`store-python-lifecycle` suites extended, not weakened (all LC/SP checks stay).
- **F** status subscription semantics suite: initial read, edge order, unsubscribe, late events, observer exceptions (Node + host-page e2e).
- **G** `tests/runtime-boundary.test.cjs`: structural scan of `src/runtime/*` + the runtime classic files + `dist/` copies — forbidden: imports of/references to Harness/Product modules (`agent`, `store`, `persistence`, `extensions`, `capability*`, `attachment*`, `approval`, `model`, `ui/`, Vue), Product DOM ids (`py-worker-src`, `grep-worker-src`, `sb-python`), `LOCUS_HOME_SKELETON` reads in Runtime files, `EXTENSION_*` global reads in shell.js. Paired with gate A's real execution (structure + behavior, not grep alone). Also pins contract-pattern equality with `extensions.js`.

## 12. Review round (M2a review fixes, appended after `8b44a42`)

The review of PR #5 identified three gaps. First-round failure evidence is preserved verbatim in [REPOSITORY-SPLIT-M2A-REVIEW-FIRST-ROUND.txt](REPOSITORY-SPLIT-M2A-REVIEW-FIRST-ROUND.txt) (30+ failing checks on the pre-fix implementation). M2b/M2c/M3 remain out of scope.

### 12.1 The session owns the FULL execution lifecycle (gap 1)

The M2a session tracked only the interpreter instance; a composite shell execution (VFS writes, grep, curl, python-inside-shell) was invisible to `busyExecutions`, to the prepare barrier, and to reset/dispose — the first round demonstrated `busyExecutions: 0` with a write in flight, the second write executing after a reset, and a clean `ok: true` for a boundary-struck run.

The session now tracks EVERY accepted public `execute` from admission to complete settlement:

- **Tracking**: one `inflight` set, entry added synchronously at admission, `done` assigned synchronously, released exactly once in the run's own `finally`. Composite work lives INSIDE its one execute entry — shell-internal python/grep is never counted twice (R8a pins busy=2 for one python + one shell, R8b/c pin per-seat release).
- **Session-owned invalidation plane**: each execute gets an internal `AbortController` MERGED with the caller's signal (caller abort → merged abort with the caller's reason; session boundary → merged abort with the boundary reason). The underlying shell/python/curl machinery already re-checks the signal between steps and before every side effect, so a boundary lands without the caller ever aborting. Already-dispatched provider operations settle and are reported honestly (the parked first write commits; the second write never dispatches; the run reports `ok: false`); the report carries an ADDITIVE `boundary` field naming the boundary (the session's cancellation plane may preempt the instance's own generation check). Never a rollback, never a fake success.
- **Busyness**: `status().busyExecutions` is the session's own count (admission → settlement), replacing the instance count in the session snapshot.
- **Termination paths**: `reset` (reusable boundary), `dispose` (terminal, idempotent, keeps the first reason), `host.dispose` (all sessions) — all bump the boundary generation, fire the invalidation plane, and forward to the instance (M1b semantics verbatim). Queued-but-not-started executes refuse cancellation-shaped; every listener registration is released exactly once.

### 12.2 Session boundary algebra ≠ interpreter rebuild algebra (gap 2)

The M2a prepare judged its no-late-effect check against the INSTANCE generation — which a same-stack `prepare(A)`'s legitimate rebuild also bumps, so `prepare(B)` misjudged A's rebuild as an external reset (first round: B refused, final key `env-a`).

Two separate algebras now:

- **Session boundary generation** (session-owned): bumped by `session.reset/dispose` ONLY. A waiting prepare refuses iff this moved (`reset while preparation waited ... (<boundary reason>)`).
- **Interpreter generation** (instance-owned): moves on legitimate prepare rebuilds too. The prepare chain tracks `chainPyGeneration` — the generation the CHAIN last observed or produced — and refuses only when the instance generation moved OUTSIDE the chain (`reset outside the preparation chain`), which detects out-of-band `pythonRuntime().reset()` seam mutations. A chained prepare's rebuild is normal serialized work; concurrent prepares apply in call order (P1: A then B, final key B, both report `rebuiltInterpreter: true`).
- A cancelled QUEUED prepare returns promptly (cancellation-shaped) but its chain segment still completes in order — a later prepare can never jump ahead of an unfinished earlier one (P3), and a failing prepare never wedges the chain (P4). A real boundary refuses EVERY prepare it crossed (P5) while the session stays usable afterwards (P2b/R7c2 — the boundary's own interpreter reset is synced into the chain algebra).
- **Execute admission** (requirement 6): a new execute waits out the prepare barrier in force at call time — it can never penetrate an in-flight prepare (R4: the admitted execute's first effect sees the prepared config; P6: an execute admitted between A and B runs after A and settles before B applies). The prepare barrier itself waits for the settlement of the executions in flight AT CALL TIME (call-time snapshot; later admissions queue behind the chain and cannot deadlock against the barrier).

Coverage: `tests/runtime-session-lifecycle.test.mjs` (48 deterministic checks — reset/dispose/host.dispose over composite shells, prepare vs non-python work, same-stack admission races, network authorization and response waits, grep across a boundary, two-session isolation, settlement-vs-busy ordering, A/B/C prepare queues with cancellation/failure/real boundaries/old-execution-unsettled/admission; event barriers and scheduling ticks only, no fixed delays prove ordering) plus the browser L-gates in `e2e-runtime-host.cjs` (the same semantics live on the packaged entry, driven through a real parked VFS and real logs).

### 12.3 The entry assembles its own dependencies (gap 3)

- `createRuntime` is now ASYNC and self-assembling: configuration is validated synchronously (bad worker assets / a broken or partial registry fail with clear errors — the A1c correction: missing LEGAL configuration errors, merely missing classic scripts does NOT), then the core resolves through the registry (delegation; the product page path) or ONE memoized dynamic import of `src/runtime/core.js` — the SAME five sources as ES modules (load order mirrors the classic page; the per-file explicit publishes appended to telemetry/workspace/vfs/network.js keep the classic bare-global cross-file references working in both modes). The product bundle never fetches the self-assembly chunk (verified: `classicScriptTags === 0` and the registry published, live in the browser).
- **VFS exports**: `createWorkspace` (VirtualWorkspace, with the runtime's own shell command surface as the `listCommands` default), `createMemoryWorkspace`, `shellCommandNames` — a host imports one module and builds a filesystem without any classic global (the standalone host page now carries ZERO classic scripts).
- **Boundary gate G7**: the entry's transitive ESM import closure is walked structurally — every reached file must be Runtime-owned, and the closure must cover the whole core (worker-assets stays host-injected by design).
- **Product wiring**: store.js resolves the session via the seam-first sync accessor (`ensureRuntimeSession`) plus `whenRuntimeSession()` for the task path (`wiredToolExecutor` and `preparePythonRuntimeForEnvironment` await it); main.js attaches the status subscription after resolution. The standalone host page imports the entry + worker assets ONLY; `tests/runtime-self-assembly.test.mjs` proves cold import → self-assembly → VFS exports → execution with zero classic scripts and zero DOM.
- **Boot rebind fix (found by the honest boundary)**: `bootPersistence` re-ran `providerSessions.restoreInto` on the conversation THIS boot had just created — a spurious `session.reset()` (provider-session.js:109) that, with the new session-owned invalidation, cancelled unrelated in-flight executes on the product page (first seen as the network suite's N4 approval card dying). Boot now rebinds only onto a DIFFERENT conversation (archived boots still rebind and replay; fresh boots skip the meaningless reset).

### 12.4 Verification of the review round

First round evidence preserved (pre-fix); then: unit gate 50/50 suites (incl. the two new suites), `vite build`, the standalone-host e2e (22 checks incl. H0b/c assembly proofs and L1–L5 live boundary semantics), the FULL browser e2e (17/17 suites), and an interactive browser pass driving BOTH the standalone host and the full product page through the same parked-composite/boundary flow with event-barrier logs (zero classic scripts on the host page; product chain executes, boundary blocks the second write, commits the dispatched one, busy drains, zero page errors).

## 13. Review round 2 (post-`7f0eee07`): the two remaining session gaps

The second review of PR #5 found two gaps against the round-1 contract. Pre-fix failure evidence on `7f0eee07` (implementation unfixed, only the suite extended): [REPOSITORY-SPLIT-M2A-REVIEW-SECOND-ROUND.txt](REPOSITORY-SPLIT-M2A-REVIEW-SECOND-ROUND.txt) — 17 failing checks (13 × F1, 4 × F2). The binding shape: THREE distinct time points — the caller's cancellation answer, the internal queue/barrier positions, the provider operation's true settlement — no one implies another (contracts §3.1, review round 2).

### 13.1 Result classification (gap F1)

A boundary (or caller abort) landing while a run's LAST provider operation is dispatched-but-unsettled leaves NO later cancellation checkpoint inside the command: the operation settles, the command reports a clean success (`isError:false` / `success:true`), and round-1's session kept `ok:true` with only an additive `boundary` field — so the Product tool router read `res.ok` and reported success for a superseded run.

Design: every execute captures its FIRST invalidation in its own closure (`struck`) at strike time — the session-global `boundaryReason` may be rewritten by a later reset before the result forms — and ONE small classification pass runs on the resolved result before it leaves the session (`classifyResult(res, isShell)` in `src/runtime/index.js`):

- **Boundary-struck** → never a clean success: `ok:false` + `isError:true` (shell) / `success:false` (python), the ADDITIVE `boundary` field names the run's own first reason, the explanation is appended to `output`/`stderr`, the original text and every existing field (`io`/`backend`/`operation`, stdout/stderr, commit reports) are kept, `io.out` accounts for the note (UTF-8).
- **Caller abort** → downgrades only a report that never observed the abort (no cancellation checkpoint ran after the last dispatched operation): that clean success becomes an honest failure explained as `execution cancelled`, WITHOUT a `boundary` field (a caller cancel is not a session boundary). An ALREADY-FAILED report ('bash: cancelled' / 'python: execution cancelled') IS the cancellation report and stays byte-identical — the grep-worker C1/R2 exact-output pins hold unchanged.
- **Underlying throw** → never reaches the classifier (existing propagation). Real worker/provider errors keep precedence — the note is additive, never a downgrade of detail (X-E: provider failure + boundary keeps BOTH).
- The instance lifecycle (generation, pre-dispatch checks, final-report check) is untouched; the classifier is the session-level last word that also covers what the instance cannot see (a caller abort is invisible to the interpreter's generation algebra).

Deliberate re-specification: grep-worker R1 pinned "abort after the worker reply → clean success". The reply delivery and the abort were jammed into one synchronous block, so "had the provider work already settled when the abort landed" is not observable at the session layer (promise resolution notifies only via microtasks, which always lose to synchronous abort listeners); the contract-level rule (a run whose caller aborted before the execute settled is not reported as a success) therefore WINS, and R1 now pins the honest form: exactly one settlement, result text kept in the output, cancellation named. C1/R2 keep their exact pins.

### 13.2 Prepare queue segment vs caller cancellation (gap F2)

Round-1's cancelled waiting prepare raced its chain wait against the abort and released its segment in a `finally` — so a later execute admitted after the cancellation could slip past an UNFINISHED earlier segment (Q-A: probe entered with nothing applied). The segment and the caller's answer are now two separate promises in `prepare()`:

- **Internal segment** (`internalSegment`): waits out `prev`'s TRUE settlement (no race), then judges liveness (disposed → boundary → aborted) at its turn — a cancelled prepare skips its configuration but still ENDS ITS SEGMENT IN ORDER — then waits the CALL-TIME settlement snapshot, re-validates, and applies via the instance's synchronous prepare (chain-generation algebra unchanged). Call-time capture keeps the no-deadlock property: later-admitted executes never extend an earlier prepare's barrier.
- **`prepareTail`** = the segment's settlement barrier, failure-proofed (`then(→undefined, →undefined)`): a rejected segment never poisons the queue (P4 semantics preserved).
- **Caller's answer** = a cancellable OBSERVATION of the segment: abort listener registered synchronously at call time (before and after-aborted both covered), prompt AbortError on abort, listener removed when the observation ends, and the segment's rejection is always handled (by the observation AND by `prepareTail`) — a caller that cancelled early can never produce an unhandled rejection.

Coverage: the strengthened P3 (a probe execute queued behind the CHAIN plus the recorded application order — "extensionKey still null" proved nothing, since C could have been blocked by its own settlement snapshot) and the new Q-A..Q-E: cancelled waiting prepare answers its caller while holding the chain; the A/B/C queue with B cancelled records the REAL application order; several cancelled members release nothing; a failing prepare with a real boundary/dispose drains without wedging; prepare/execute interleave without circular waiting. F1: X-A..X-G (reset/dispose/host.dispose over the unsettled LAST write, caller abort in the same window, double reset keeps the FIRST reason, clean control untouched, provider failure + boundary keeps both, direct python with the caller abort during the last commit write, the REAL executeTool reports `success:false`). All deterministic — event barriers and scheduling ticks only.
