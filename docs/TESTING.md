# Locus testing philosophy

Locus tests contracts, not just happy paths.

## 1. Layers

`npm test` covers fast Node/unit contracts.

`npm run test:e2e` uses real Chrome where the browser is part of the claim: OPFS/File System Access semantics, CSP inheritance, Workers, Pyodide, UI approvals, image materialization, and request-counter network oracles.

REAL-WORLD-50 provides deterministic trajectory verification for ordinary agent work.

## 2. Security proof style

“No request occurred” uses request counters, not exception text.

“Approval protected state” covers denial, cancellation, stale decisions, and TOCTOU.

“Replay is safe” covers dangling/uncheckpointed tool suffixes, not only clean conversations.

## 3. Synthetic infrastructure proofs

Synthetic components are acceptable when they isolate an infrastructure contract. Capability Composition uses synthetic descriptors/module payloads so product selection does not contaminate architecture proof.

The boundary under test should remain real.

## 4. Closure gate

Typical closure includes targeted tests, adversarial browser tests, `npm test`, build, full E2E, relevant REAL-WORLD verification, documentation updates, and clean linear integration into `main`.

Exact suite counts evolve; closure reports should state observed counts rather than turning them into permanent architecture facts.

## 5. Load-bearing invariants

Examples:

- intentionally small model tool registry;
- no Python user-phase network;
- verified Pyodide bootstrap;
- no ambiguous retry of side effects;
- provider-native replay preservation;
- immutable TaskEnvironment identity;
- explicit Skill mutation confirmation;
- private SkillInstances;
- empty production extension catalogs until product selection.

## 6. Test-only seams

Test seams must be explicit and absent from ordinary production paths. Injecting a model/catalog is fine; mocking away the boundary and then claiming the boundary is proven is not.

## 7. Documentation drift

Contradictory documentation is a bug. Before closing an architecture phase, search for future features described as current, old tool names/paths, changed authority rules, and stale milestone status.

## 8. Capability authoring acceptance

Capability authoring must be tested from a real source project boundary, not by injecting runtime catalogs.

The Reference Capability E2E should prove:

```
source project
 -> validator
 -> builder
 -> explicit import
 -> package registration
 -> enable
 -> verified Plugin install
 -> Skill materialization
 -> ordinary next-task use
 -> Skill customization approval
 -> Remove / re-add reset
```

The self-hosting E2E goes one step further: Locus creates the source project through the same public authoring contract, but an explicit user action still performs the package trust/import transition.

A test-only `replaceCatalogs` seam is acceptable for composition-unit tests and **not** acceptable as evidence that authoring/import works.

The implemented package core is covered from the real source-project
boundary: `tests/capability-package.test.cjs` loads the fixture project
`tests/fixtures/capability-package/minimal` (including a byte-verified,
RECORD-checked synthetic pure-Python wheel) through a
`WorkspaceAdapter` provider and proves validation, deterministic build,
byte isolation, safe inspect, bounds, path traversal rejection and
zero-write behavior. That is unit evidence for validate/build/inspect
only - it is NOT evidence that import, registration or enablement works,
and NOT evidence that Package Core validates arbitrary wheel bytes.
P40 proves the prepared FIXTURE is a real wheel; runtime installability
of an author artifact is Trusted Plugin Runtime work (offline install +
smoke import before READY).

TPR v1A closes exactly that gap at the runtime layer:
`tests/python-plugin-runtime.test.cjs` (unit: harness-side payload
validation, own-copy isolation, worker install lifecycle, integrity
fail-closed against the REAL worker source) and
`tests/e2e-python-plugin-runtime.cjs` (browser: the real fixture wheel
offline-installed in the real strict-CSP worker before READY, answer 42,
integrity/smoke adversarial, crash/reset/cancellation recovery, and
request-counter proof that boot, install, and every post-READY package
escape contribute ZERO unauthorized network requests). Package Core
identity is therefore proven distinct from runtime installability: an
identity-valid non-wheel fails the boot closed at the install step.
