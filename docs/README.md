# Locus documentation

This directory is the wiki-style documentation home for Locus.

The repository keeps documentation beside code so architecture changes, tests, and prose can move in the same commit graph. A separate hosted wiki may mirror or link these pages later; **the repository documents are the source of truth**.

The three-repository split is a target architecture, not an implemented feature. The migration M0 audit and contract round, M1 (task assembly + interpreter lifecycle), M2a (Runtime independentization), M2b (Harness independentization) and M2c (public capability declarations + the Product compatibility gate + joint integration gates) are complete (see the REPOSITORY-SPLIT-\* documents above); M3 (repository extraction) and M4 (integration/lock) remain pending.

Project status lives in [../ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md). Implementation backlog lives in [../TODO.md](../TODO.md).

## What is normative?

1. **Code + tests** — evidence of what current `main` actually does.
2. **Architecture / security / concept docs** — intended invariants; implementation changes should update them deliberately.
3. **Roadmap / TODO** — status and future work, not permission to claim a future feature exists.
4. **Candidate studies** — `docs/plugins/` explores possibilities; none is selected merely because a requirements document exists.
5. **Audit snapshots** — `Locus-audit-*.md` describes a historical commit and may intentionally contain facts later fixed.

When two current normative documents disagree, treat it as a documentation bug.

## Current architecture in one screen

```
User
  |
Capability
  |---- Plugin        local code, no authority in v1
  |---- SkillInstance capability-private mutable guidance
  |---- MCP           external authority requirement
  |
TaskEnvironment (frozen identity snapshot)
  |
AgentSession / Harness
  |
  +---- Provider protocol / model input
  |       +---- Perception / image gate
  |
  +---- bash
          +---- VFS -------- Filesystem
          +---- Python ----- Execution
          +---- curl ------- Network

Current model tools: bash + cloud_bash (stub)
```

Production extension catalogs are currently empty. Trusted Plugin Runtime v1 is the next extension-layer infrastructure milestone.

## Maintenance rule

New implementation work should answer:

- Which invariant does this rely on or change?
- Which document owns that invariant?
- Which test proves the new statement?

If the answer is “none”, the change probably needs a contract before it needs more code.
